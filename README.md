# Listenr: Record, Correct, and Fine-tune Your Own Whisper Model

Listenr is a privacy-first, end-to-end pipeline for building a personalised Whisper model from your own voice. Record audio, have a local LLM clean up the transcriptions, fine-tune any `openai/whisper-*` model on that data, and deploy a standalone model — all running locally on your hardware via [Lemonade Server](https://lemonade-server.ai). No audio, text, or model weights ever leave your machine.

> **Scope:** The recording and fine-tuning pipeline is built around Whisper (whisper.cpp for capture, `WhisperForConditionalGeneration` for training). The dataset format — `manifest.jsonl` → HuggingFace dataset — is model-agnostic and can feed any ASR trainer.

## Why Listenr?

- **Local-only, private by design.** No cloud APIs. All inference runs on your CPU, GPU, or NPU via Lemonade Server.
- **Open models.** Uses Whisper.cpp for transcription and any GGUF-compatible LLM for post-processing correction.
- **Automatic correction pipeline.** A local LLM cleans up punctuation, grammar, and homophones — producing a higher-quality training corpus than raw Whisper output alone.
- **Real-world data.** Collects natural, conversational speech in realistic environments, including domain-specific vocabulary that generic models get wrong.
- **Dataset-ready output.** Every utterance is saved with its audio clip and appended to a single `manifest.jsonl`. One command builds train/dev/test splits in HuggingFace dataset format.
- **Full fine-tuning pipeline.** LoRA fine-tuning of any `openai/whisper-*` model on AMD or NVIDIA GPU via a pre-built Podman container. No environment setup — just `podman compose run`.
- **Deploy anywhere.** `listenr-merge` folds the LoRA adapter into a self-contained `WhisperForConditionalGeneration` that loads with plain `transformers`, no PEFT required.

## How It Works

1. **Capture** — `listenr` streams your microphone to Lemonade's `/realtime` WebSocket in ~85 ms chunks, resampled to 16 kHz.
2. **VAD** — Lemonade's built-in voice activity detection segments speech boundaries automatically.
3. **Transcribe** — Lemonade runs Whisper.cpp on each segment and streams back transcripts.
4. **Correct (optional)** — a local LLM cleans the transcript and tags content categories.
5. **Save** — each utterance is saved as a `.wav` clip and a line in `manifest.jsonl`.
6. **Build dataset** — `listenr-build-dataset` writes train/dev/test splits from the manifest.
7. **Fine-tune** — `listenr-finetune` trains a LoRA adapter on top of a Whisper base model using your collected data.
8. **Merge** — `listenr-merge` folds the adapter into the base model, producing a self-contained model that needs only `transformers`.
9. **Test** — `scripts/test_merged.py` runs the merged model against your clips and compares output to the original Whisper transcriptions.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rebreda/listenr
cd listenr
uv pip install -e .
lemonade-server serve   # in another terminal
uv run listenr          # start recording
```

Once you have recordings, the full pipeline runs as:

```bash
# Build train/dev/test splits from your manifest
uv run listenr-build-dataset --format hf

# Fine-tune Whisper (see docs/finetune-amd.md for AMD GPUs)
podman compose run --rm finetune

# Merge the LoRA adapter into a standalone model
podman compose run --rm merge

# Test it against your clips
python scripts/test_merged.py --keyword YourDomainWord
```
